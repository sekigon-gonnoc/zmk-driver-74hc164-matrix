compatible: "zmk,kscan-74hc164-matrix"

include: kscan.yaml

properties:
  data-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: GPIO for the data pin of the 74HC164 shift register

  clk-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: GPIO for the clock pin of the 74HC164 shift register

  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: GPIO for the reset pin of the 74HC164 shift register

  power-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: GPIO for the power control pin

  row-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: GPIOs for row scanning of the matrix

  rows:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Number of rows in the matrix

  columns:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Number of columns in the matrix

  debounce-period:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Debounce period in milliseconds (deprecated, use debounce-press-ms
      and debounce-release-ms instead)

  debounce-press-ms:
    type: int
    description: Debounce time for key press in milliseconds

  debounce-release-ms:
    type: int
    description: Debounce time for key release in milliseconds

  debounce-scan-period-ms:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Time between matrix scans while debouncing in milliseconds.
      This is also used for the scan rate when keys are pressed.

  poll-period-ms:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Time between matrix scans when no keys are pressed in milliseconds.
      Higher values will reduce power consumption.

  wakeup-source:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If enabled, the matrix scan can be used as a wakeup source for the system.
      This is useful for low-power operation.
